About Me
======
My name is Isabel Lockhart and I am an undergraduate student at DePaul University in Chicago. I am majoring in Astrophysics with a minor in Mathematics and I am set to graduate in spring of 2027. Originally from Washington, I moved to Chicago in 2023 for university. Outside of academics, I love to spend time reading, baking cookies, and watching hockey! 

Background
======
Freshman year at DePaul, I became greatly interested in the universe at a large scale. The following summer I did research in computational astrophysics learning about star formation through the IllustrisTNG 300-1 simulation.
