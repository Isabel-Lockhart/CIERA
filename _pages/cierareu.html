Introduction <br><br>

Exoplanets, planets that exist outside of our solar system, are often found orbiting stars. However, imaging these planets can be challenging as the glare of 
these bright stars makes it difficult to see what is nearby. That glare can be reduced by a device called a coronagraph, one of which will be equipped on the 
Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Unlike traditional coronagraphs that use an opaque disk to entirely block the light of the star, the coronagraph aboard the 
Roman Space Telescope is designed to create destructive interference with the light of the star creating a dark hole for the telescope to image. This interference 
drastically reduces the glare from the star while still allowing light from orbiting planets to be seen, while deformable mirrors are used to correct distortions 
that may be caused as a result. Because of the deformable mirrors and other technology that makes up the Roman Space Telescope’s coronagraph, it is projected to be 
two to three orders of magnitude more powerful than any other space-flown coronagraph. <br><br>

The enhanced sensitivity of the coronagraph makes it a very powerful instrument, but it also makes it more susceptible to outside light sources. Because of this, it 
is imperative that the stars being imaged by the telescope are not binary stars. A companion star being present causes there to be additional light in the dark hole 
created by the coronagraph, impacting the telescope’s ability to see exoplanets. Thus, reference star vetting is necessary to ensure each science target is a single 
star and not a part of a binary system. In order to compile an accurate and deep dataset for each of these target stars, one must use the data from multiple instruments 
in order to optimize the likelihood of finding a potential companion star. The Gemini Observatory’s NIRI is one such instrument. <br><br>

While bright stars cause complications relating to imaging exoplanets, they are also entirely necessary as their light makes the exoplanets visible. Alpha Cephei, being 
the brightest star in the Cepheus constellation, fits this criteria perfectly making it a reference star candidate. To ensure that Alpha Cephei is not a binary star, we 
utilize data reduction techniques to clean and analyze the images taken by the Gemini Observatory's NIRI.
