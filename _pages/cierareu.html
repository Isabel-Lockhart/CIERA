Introduction
Exoplanets, planets that exist outside of our solar system, are often found orbiting stars. However, imaging these planets can be challenging as the glare of these bright stars makes it difficult to see what is nearby. That glare can be reduced by a device called a coronagraph, one of which will be equipped on the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Unlike traditional coronagraphs that use an opaque disk to entirely block the light of the star, the coronagraph aboard the Roman Space Telescope is designed to create destructive interference with the light of the star creating a dark hole for the telescope to image. This interference drastically reduces the glare from the star while still allowing light from orbiting planets to be seen, while deformable mirrors are used to correct distortions that may be caused as a result. Because of the deformable mirrors and other technology that makes up the Roman Space Telescopeâ€™s coronagraph, it is projected to be two to three orders of magnitude more powerful than any other space-flown coronagraph.
